### NPM Gotchas

- Nodemon repeatedly spawning new processes? Kill it before it kills your machine.
  - Ensure the processes that are being started aren't already running in the background: node, ng, gulp, nodemon, redis-server.
- Redis server error: Redis server binary must be installed on the host machine, the npm library merely references it.
- Sass-loader error: Remove node_modules, clear npm cache and re-install.


### Installation

Download repo and install dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/justiceo/whatsapp-web-template
cd whatsapp-web-template
npm install
```

Install redis (for server app):

Follow guide here https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/.

Then install nodejs wrapper:
```
npm i redis
```

To build the server:
```
tsc --outDir dist src/server/index.js
```

To start up server (which would serve template):
```
redis-server (start redis)
node dist/index.js
```

To use angular-cli to serve the web app alone:
```
npm i -g @angular/cli
ng serve
```

### Deploying

Build the UI and server (requires installation of @angular/cli and gulp@4):
```
ng build 
gulp build
```

Install PM2 and start the server (starts webapp at http://localhost:3000):
```
npm i -g pm2
pm2 start dist/index.js
```

There are several ways to view it at http://chat-domain.com, below is one using apache2 proxy (requires mod_proxy):
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName  chat-domain.com

  # Point to pm2 or node instance of whatsapp web
  ProxyPass             / http://localhost:3000/
  ProxyPassReverse      / http://localhost:3000/
</VirtualHost>
```
